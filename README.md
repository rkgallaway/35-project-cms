### Modules
#### `modulename.js`
##### Exported Values and Methods

## Requirements
* Fork the repository, unzip, and install the react application on your local environment
* Develop and test locally instead of at Code Sandbox
  * You will need to rename the `env` file to `.env` 
  * Add a `.gitignore` file so you don't check-in your node modules.
  * Remove .env from your .gitignore. AWS will need this do your build properly
* Fix the application (it's got a few bugs for you to trace down before it will work properly)
* Document, with JSDoc every method in the components as well as the actions and reducers
* Draw on a whiteboard a complete UML diagram for the code
* Draw on a whiteboard a data-flow diagram for each user workflow (list models, list records, etc)
* Write tests to assert that things are working as expected
* Apply some styling!
  * Make this easy and intuitive for a user to use
  * The User Interface and Experience are completely up to you
#### Running the app
